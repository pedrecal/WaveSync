# WaveSync

A web-based tool for synchronizing subtitle files (SRT) with videos that have frame drops or timing issues. WaveSync visualizes audio waveforms alongside subtitles to help identify correct sync points and generate properly synchronized subtitle files.

## Current Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Svelte 5 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Audio Processing:**
  - WaveSurfer.js for waveform visualization and interaction
  - Custom SRT parser with robust time format handling

## Project Status

âœ… **Fully Functional** - Core subtitle synchronization problem solved!

### âœ… Implemented Features

- [x] SRT file parsing and display
- [x] Audio waveform visualization with interactive controls
- [x] Visual subtitle regions overlaid on waveform
- [x] Click-to-create sync points with real-time feedback
- [x] Linear interpolation algorithm for timing corrections
- [x] Real-time subtitle preview with automatic corrections
- [x] Non-linear timing adjustment via multiple sync points
- [x] Export of corrected SRT files
- [x] Keyboard navigation (spacebar, arrows) with zoom-aware seeking
- [x] Precise time input navigation (HH:MM:SS.mmm format)
- [x] Visual feedback system with color-coded regions
- [x] Accessibility compliance with ARIA attributes

## How to Use

1. **Load Audio**: Select an audio file to display the waveform
2. **Import SRT**: Load your subtitle file - subtitles appear as blue regions on the waveform
3. **Navigate**: Use playback controls, keyboard (spacebar/arrows), or time input to find misaligned subtitles
4. **Create Sync Points**: Click on the waveform where a subtitle should actually start - creates a green corrected region
5. **Automatic Corrections**: All other subtitles update automatically using interpolation
6. **Export**: Download your corrected SRT file when satisfied with the sync

### Keyboard Controls

- **Spacebar**: Play/pause audio
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Seek backward/forward (amount scales with zoom level)
- **Up/Down Arrows**: Zoom in/out
- **Click waveform**: Focus waveform for keyboard control (yellow glow indicates focus)

The app handles non-linear timing drift by interpolating corrections between your sync points, making it perfect for videos with frame drops or variable timing issues.

## Technical Details

## Technical Architecture

**Core Algorithm**: Linear interpolation between user-defined sync points

- Single sync point: Apply constant offset to all subtitles
- Multiple sync points: Interpolate corrections between points
- Extrapolation: Extend corrections beyond first/last sync point

**Key Components:**

- `SimpleWavePlayer.svelte`: Main waveform component with sync functionality
- `srt-parser.ts`: Robust SRT file parsing with multiple time format support
- `SubtitleDisplay.svelte`: Real-time subtitle display above waveform
- WaveSurfer.js integration with Regions and Hover plugins for interactive waveform

**Why Svelte over SvelteKit?**
This is a single-page audio processing tool that doesn't require routing or server-side features. The lighter Vite + Svelte setup provides faster development and simpler deployment for this specific use case.

**Accessibility Features:**

- Full keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Visual focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

- Video preview integration
- Sync point import/export
- Undo/redo functionality
- Enhanced UI/UX polish
